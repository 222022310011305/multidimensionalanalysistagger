In this passage, most of children are limited media consumption by their parents, but research finds that the key is the nature of it not the time-long. There no correlation between limiting device using and childrenâ€™s will-being. For young children, whether parents engage in online activities with them is important. The consensus is that screen time is not harmful, what parents should do is to ensure the content of children is high quality and correct, and get involved. 
However, this article ignores the harm that exposure to electronic devices for too long time can bring to the body.  It is recommended to limit children's time on the Internet not only because children will browse bad information on the Internet, but also because too long online time will do harm to children's health, such as myopia, hunchback, lack of sleep and so on. However, parental involvement does not solve or alleviate these conditions. A more serious situation is that in the modern Internet era, a lot of bad information is passively received by us, such as when we open the browser, some bad things will automatically appear. Some films and television works will secretly hide some bad thinking, these problems can not be solved by parents. Another point is that parents and children's hobbies are not the same, sometimes parents like to see the child does not like, which can not play the network pertinence, but also reduce the Internet experience, which will make the child feel no privacy space.
In short, limiting children's media time is not only to prevent children from browsing bad information, but more for the sake of children's physical health, and parental participation can not effectively solve and avoid these situations.
