# The Multidimensional Analysis Tagger

The Multidimensional Analysis Tagger (MAT) is a program that replicates Biber's (1988) Variation across Speech and Writing tagger for the multidimensional functional analysis of English texts, generally applied for studies on text type or genre variation. The program can generate a grammatically annotated version of the corpus selected as well as the statistics needed to perform a text-type or genre analysis. The program plots the input text or corpus on Biberâ€™s (1988) Dimensions and it determines its closest text type, as proposed by Biber (1989) A Typology of English Texts. Finally, the program offers a tool for visualising the Dimensions features of an input text. More information about the tagger can be found in the manual at the official website of MAT: https://sites.google.com/site/multidimensionaltagger

MAT is based on the Stanford Tagger. More information on the Stanford Tagger can be obtained from: http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml. The Stanford Tagger or a corpus of Stanford Tagger tagged texts is required to run MAT.
